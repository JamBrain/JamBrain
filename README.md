The new Ludum Dare website (Project: LD2015). Currently, 

This is the LIVE WEBSITE code, as customized for ludumdare.com by the Ludum Dare web team. 

It contains a snapshot of ld-cms (Ludum Dare Content Management System), and customizations by the web team. It may ocassionally contain updates not found in in ld-cms (or vice versa), but the goal is to keep both code-bases up to date.
