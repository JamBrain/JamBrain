<?php
/*
	Summary of this program and its intent:
	
This is an API test for the ludumdare website. It's goal is to interact with all API functionality by simulating a ludumdare.
Users will be created, an event will be created, users will post, read other users posts, post comments, like, etc.
Users will interact with the theme creation process stages, will publish games, will rate each other's games, and will observe the results.
The script will keep track of (some/much of) the data it generates, and will verify that what it sees is what it expects.
(Future) Users will maliciously interact with the API to verify that things cannot be changed (e.g. votes, theme creation) outside of the time when they are enabled to be changed.

The exact flow will be documented in the data structures that guide the process, below.
