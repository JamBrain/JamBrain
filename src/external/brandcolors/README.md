> #### [About BrandColors](https://notes.brandcolors.net/about/)
>   BrandColors was created in July 2012 by me (Galen Gidman) as a fun side project.
    The goal was to create a helpful reference for the brand color codes that I needed most often.
    The original site contained roughly 30 colors, took about an hour-and-a-half to code, and lived on my personal site.  
    Since then it has moved to its own domain, had 4 major redesigns with countless revisions, been featured by Smashing Magazine, 
    CSS-Tricks, Web Design Depot, Tuts+, and had nearly 1.5 million pageviews. 
    There are now over 500 brands with 1400 colors and the collection is always growing.

They maintain a repo for feedback [here](https://github.com/brandcolors)
