The new Ludum Dare website (codename: Starship, formerly LD2015).

The code is not live on ludumdare.com, but instead here:

https://ldjam.com

This snapshot isn't necessarily the latest version, but something deemed stable enough to push to the live server for testing.

Other Ludum Dare service URLs:

* https://api.ldjam.com/v1/    - Data API 
* https://auth.ldjam.com/v1/ * - Authentication API (internal, HTTPS only)
* https://pusher.ldjam.com/v1/ - Upload API 
* https://static.ldjam.org     - Static content
* https://static.jamdb.org     - Static content (mirror)
* https://ldj.am               - URL shortener 
* https://jammer.bio           - Jammer Bio's 
* https://jam.host             - Jam Hosting

NOTE: At this time, HTTPS is broken (awaiting a fix in LSWS).

Things we can't test locally using DairyBox: Cloudflare/CDN features, HTTPS.

Once it matures, portions of this code may eventually become the LD-CMW project.
